## Q:

## A:
- Smartphones
- GPS
- Cheap cellular data

===

### Other non-essential factors:
- Marketing
- Lobbying
- Venture funding
- Logistics
- Data Science
- Global Scale

===

## The only essential ingredients:
- Citizen participation

## The technology is not rocket-science
### It's collaboration software

## What if:
### You didn't need a team of developers to build and operate a TNC?

===

## What if:
### You didn't need any developers at all?

Note: Starting a carpool group should be as easy as installing an app, and that app
should work as well as the ride-sharing apps we've recently grown to love, more recently
started to miss.

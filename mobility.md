# Ridesharing works!

<->

## Q:
### What is fundamentally driving adoption of ridesharing?
## A:
- Cellular Networks
- GPS
- Smartphones

===

### Other non-essential factors:
- Marketing
- Lobbying
- Venture funding
- Global Scale
- Advanced Logistics
- Data Science / Machine Learning

===

## The only essential ingredients:
- Citizen participation
- Information sharing

===

## The technology is not rocket-science
### It's collaboration software

<->

## What if:
### You didn't need a team of developers to build and operate a TNC?

===

## What if:
### You didn't need any developers at all?

Note: Starting a carpool group should be as easy as installing an app, and that app
should work as well as the ride-sharing apps we've recently grown to love, and more
recently really started to miss.
